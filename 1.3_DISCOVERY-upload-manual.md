# manual upload to Maven Central Portal

Based on previous deploy to `target/deploy` local directory, it's easy to create a deployment bundle:

    tar cvf deploy-bundle.tar -C target/deploy org

then upload with Maven Central Portal ["Publish Component" UI](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-upload/) (publication is expected to fail because you don't have permissions on the groupId, but you can test and see the behaviour).

Upload can also be done [using `curl`](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-api/#uploading-a-deployment-bundle) to the [`/api/v1/publisher/upload`](https://central.sonatype.com/api-doc) API:

    curl --request POST \
    --verbose \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ZXhhbXBsZV91c2VybmFtZTpleGFtcGxlX3Bhc3N3b3Jk' \
    --form bundle=@deploy-bundle.tar \
    https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher/upload
