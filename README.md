# deployment solutions study

Study to better understand [maven-deploy-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/), how it deploys artifacts traditionnally to a [Maven repository](https://maven.apache.org/repository/layout.html),
and how the new Maven Central Portal publication changes the approach.

This study starts with a [base discovery](1_DISCOVERY.md) of the problem space.

This will be followed by an evaluation... TBD...
