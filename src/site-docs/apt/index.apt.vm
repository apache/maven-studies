Apache Maven Default Plugins Parent POM

    This project consists of a POM that lock down plugins versions that are
    referenced by Maven in {{{/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html}default lifecycle bindings}}
    and {{{/ref/current/maven-model-builder/super-pom.html}super-POM}}, and classical plugins.

    It is expected to use this POM as parent POM for any project that does not want
    to write down itself the list of plugins.

    It also provides default UTF-8 encoding and compilation for Java 1.7.
